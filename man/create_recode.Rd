\usage{
create_recode(old_var, new_var, old_value = NULL, new_value = NULL,
  new_label = NULL, start_year = NULL, end_year = NULL,
  var_label = NULL, simplify2numeric = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{old_var}{character. Column in the dataset containing the values to be recoded}

\item{new_var}{character. Column where the recoded values will be placed. If `new_var` doesn't exist, than it will be created. Otherwise it will be overwritten.}

\item{old_value}{character (or coercible). value in the column `old_var` to be translated into a new value by recoding. If left blank/NA/""/NULL or otherwise missing, the recode operation
will essentially take the form of a rename of `old_var` -> `new_var`.
Except for renaming type situations, nothing of old_var is kept (e.g. all relevant values must have a recode row)}

\item{new_value}{character (or coercible). Column indicating where the new values for the recoding process exist. It is positionally (e.g. row) tied to a particular `old_value`.
If blank, it helps identify a simpler rename operation.}

\item{new_label}{character (or convertable to character). The factor label that `old_value` will be recoded to in conjunction with the position of `new_value`}

\item{start_year}{Integer (or coercible). Year of the data that this recode starts to be relevant (inclusive). If blank, all years before `end_year` are assumed.}

\item{end_year}{Integer (or coercible). Year of the data that this recode ends it relevance (inclusive). If blank, it indicates that the recode is valid for
all years after `start_year`}

\item{var_label}{character. Variable label.}

\item{simplify2numeric}{logical.
