\usage{
create_recode(
  old_var,
  new_var,
  old = NULL,
  new = NULL,
  new_label = NULL,
  simplify_to_numeric = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{old_var}{character. Column in the dataset containing the values to be recoded}

\item{new_var}{character. Column where the recoded values will be placed. If `new_var` doesn't exist, than it will be created. Otherwise it will be overwritten.}

\item{old}{character (or coercible). value in the column `old_var` to be translated into a new value by recoding. If left blank/NA/""/NULL or otherwise missing, the recode operation
will essentially take the form of a rename of `old_var` -> `new_var`.
Except for renaming type situations, nothing of old_var is kept (e.g. all relevant values must have a recode row)}

\item{new}{character (or coercible). Column indicating where the new values for the recoding process exist. It is positionally (e.g. row) tied to a particular `old`.
If blank, it helps identify a simpler rename operation.}

\item{new_label}{character (or convertable to character). The factor label that `old` will be recoded to in conjunction with the position of `new`}

\item{simplify_to_numeric}{logical. Converts old and new into numerics if it can be done loselessly. Otherwise, a warning will be thrown.}
}
\value{
a list of lists (of class recode_instruction).
}
\description{
Creates/standardizes the parameters required for recoding a variable.
}
\details{
This function mostly exists to help translate (via \code{parse_recode_instructions}) data.frame type read-ins of recoding into a standardized form.
These results can then be passed to \code{enact_recoding} as part of a bulk recoding process.
