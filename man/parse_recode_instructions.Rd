\item{catch_NAs}{logical. Should the presence of "NA" be turned into NA_character_}

\description{
Parse Recode Instructions
}
\details{
Imports a data.frame with at a minimum of the following columns: old_var, old_value, new_var, new_value, new_label, start_year, and end_year.

old_var: Column in the dataset containing the values to be recoded

old_value: value in the column \code{old_var} to be translated into a new value by recoding. If left blank/NA/""/NULL or otherwise missing, the recode operation
will essentially take the form of a rename of \code{old_var} -> \code{new_var}

new_var: Column where the recoded values will be placed. If \code{new_var} doesn't exist, than it will be created. Otherwise it will be overwritten.

new_value: Column indicating where the new values for the recoding process exist. It is positionally (e.g. row) tied to a particular \code{old_value}.
If blank, it helps identify a simpler rename operation.

new_label: character (or convertable to character): The factor label that \code{old_value} will be recoded to in conjunction with the position of \code{new_value}
}
