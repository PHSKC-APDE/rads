\title{Get BRFSS microdata with adjusted weights for multi-year analyses from storage.}
\usage{
get_data_brfss(cols = NULL, year = NULL, wt_method = "simple")
}
\arguments{
\item{cols}{Character vector specifying which columns to include in the
returned data. If NULL, all columns identified by
\code{list_dataset_columns('brfss')} will be included. Defaults to
\code{cols = NULL}}

\item{year}{Integer vector specifying which years to include in the data.
If NULL, the most recent year available in the data set will be used. Defaults
to \code{year = NULL}}

\item{wt_method}{Character string specifying the name of the method used
to rescale the weights when selecting multiple years. Options include:
\itemize{
\item '\code{simple}': Uniform rescaling by the number of surveys. Use when the
survey years have approximately the same sample sizes
\item '\code{obs}': Rescales weights based on the number of observations per year
\item '\code{pop}': Rescales weights by the survey weighted population for each year
}

Defaults to '\code{simple}'}
}
\value{
If the requested columns \emph{\bold{do not include}} '\code{hra20_id}',
'\code{hra20_name}', or '\code{chi_geo_region}': Returns a survey-weighted
\code{\link[dtsurvey]{dtsurvey}}/data.table object with the specified columns,
years, and '\code{default_wt}` (the rescaled / adjusted weight).

If any of '\code{hra20_id}', '\code{hra20_name}', or '\code{chi_geo_region}'
are requested: Returns an \code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} comprised of
survey-weighted \code{\link[dtsurvey]{dtsurvey}}/data.table objects with the
specified columns, years, and '\code{default_wt}` (the rescales / adjusted
weight).
}
\description{
Retrieves Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data
and adjusts survey weights to ensure accurate representation for multi-year
analysis.
}
\details{
Note that while \code{get_data_brfss} automatically creates multi-year weights
for all years included in the data download, these weights may not be
appropriate for all analyses. Some BRFSS questions are only asked in specific
years, requiring custom weights to be calculated for those specific time
periods. Please refer to \code{\link{pool_brfss_weights}}
to learn how to easily re-weight and survey set the data.

As stated in the \bold{Value} section below, this function will return a
\code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} when selecting King County Health
Reporting Area (HRA) or region variables. This
is necessary because BRFSS is provided at the ZIP code level and ZIP codes
do not nest perfectly within HRAs (and regions are defined by HRAs). When using
a BRFSS \code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} as the \code{ph.data} argument
in \code{\link{calc}}, the function will properly process the
\code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} to account for the uncertainty in
allocation of ZIP codes to HRAs. In other words, it is fine if you are
unfamiliar with imputation because \code{\link{calc}} will deal with the
details for you.
