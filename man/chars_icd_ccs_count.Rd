\usage{
chars_icd_ccs_count(
  ph.data = NULL,
  icdcm_version = 10,
  icdcm = NULL,
  superlevel = NULL,
  broad = NULL,
  midlevel = NULL,
  detailed = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{ph.data}{a data.table or data.frame. Must contain CHARS data structured
with one person per row and with at least one column of ICD CM codes.

\strong{NOTE!} ph.data must have a column named \code{seq_no}, which is a unique patient
level identifier.

The default is \code{ph.data = NULL}}

\item{icdcm_version}{an integer vector of length one specifying the ICD CM
version that you want to reference. Acceptable options include: \code{9}
& \code{10}.

The default is \code{icdcm_version = 10}.}

\item{icdcm}{a character vector of length 1. An ICD CM description OR code.
It is case agnostic and works with partial strings. For example, both
'rotavira' & 'A080' would provide the results for 'Rotaviral enteritis' for
ICD-10-CM. You can also combine multiple search terms. For example,
'rotavira|choler' would count all Rotaviral enteritis AND cholera
hospitalizations. View available options with
\code{chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = 'icdcm', icdcm_version = 10)}.

The default is \code{icdcm = NULL}}

\item{superlevel}{a character vector of length 1. Case agnostic and works
with partial strings. View available options with
\code{chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = 'superlevel', icdcm_version = 10)}.

The default is \code{superlevel = NULL}}

\item{broad}{a character vector of length 1. Case agnostic and works with
partial strings. View available options with
\code{chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = 'broad', icdcm_version = 10)}.

The default is \code{broad = NULL}}

\item{midlevel}{a character vector of length 1. Case agnostic and works with
partial strings. View available options with
\code{chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = 'midlevel', icdcm_version = 10)}.

The default is \code{midlevel = NULL}}

\item{detailed}{a character vector of length 1. Case agnostic and works with
partial strings. View available options with
\code{chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = 'detailed', icdcm_version = 10)}.

The default is \code{detailed = NULL}}

\item{icdcol}{a character vector of length one that specifies the name of the
column in ph.data that contains the ICD10-cm codes of interest.

The default is \code{icdcol = 'diag1'}, which refers to the principal
diagnosis code provided by \code{get_data_chars()}).}

\item{group_by}{a character vector of indeterminate length. This is used to
specify all the variables by which you want to group (a.k.a. stratify) the
results. For example, if you specified \code{group_by = c('chi_sex',
'chi_race_6')}, the results would be stratified by each combination of sex
and race.

The default is \code{group_by = NULL}}

\item{kingco}{a logical vector of length one. It specifies whether you want to
limit the analysis to King County.

\strong{NOTE} this only works with data imported
with the \code{get_data_chars()} function because it needs the variable
\code{chi_geo_kc}.

The default is \code{kingco = TRUE}.}

\item{mykey}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the keyring:: service
that can be used to access the Health & Human Services Analytic Workspace
(HHSAW).

The default is \code{mykey = 'hhsaw'}}
}
\value{
Generates a table with columns for each of the search terms you entered (e.g.,
\code{icdcm}, \code{broad}, and/or \code{detailed}) as well as
any \code{group_by} variables and a column named \code{hospitalizations} that
contains the relevant counts.
}
\description{
Generate hospitalization counts from WA State Comprehensive Hospital
Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) data using partial strings from the ICD-10-CM
or ICD-9-CM descriptions or AHRQ HCUP's CCSR based 'broad' and 'detailed'
classifications. Needs line-level CHARS data with a properly formatted
ICD-CM column (e.g., the data available from \code{get_data_chars()}).

See \code{chars_icd_ccs()} for a complete list of available ICD-10-CM,
ICD-9-CM, and superlevel, broad, midlevel, and narrow classifications.

\strong{¡¡¡REMEMBER!!!} ICD-10-CM started in 2016! Be sure to use the correct
\strong{\code{icdcm_version}}.
}
\details{
This function needs the user to enter a search string in one or more of the
following arguments in order to search the CHARS data for the corresponding
ICD CM codes: \code{icdcm}, \code{superlevel}, \code{broad}, \code{midlevel},
or \code{detailed}.
Partial search terms are acceptable and they are case-insensitive. For
example, if you set \code{broad = 'ex'} with \code{icdcm_version = 10}, the
function would return counts for "Diseases of the eye and adnEXa" as well as
"EXternal causes of morbidity". It also understands simple regex syntax,
including \strong{\code{^}}, \strong{\code{$}}, and \strong{\code{|}}.

\strong{Note:} If you submit values for more than one of \code{icdcm},
\code{superlevel}, \code{broad}, \code{midlevel}, or \code{detailed} they must
be nested. For example, \code{broad = 'neoplasms', detailed = 'sarcoma'} will
give results because sarcomas are type of cancers. However,
\code{broad = 'neoplasms', detailed = 'intestinal infection'} will return an
error because your resulting table will have zero rows.
