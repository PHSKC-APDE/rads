and summary 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications that can be used with
\code{chars_icd_ccs_count}}

\usage{
chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = "all", mykey = "hhsaw", icdcm_version = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref_type}{a character vector of length one specifying the hospital diagnosis
descriptions that are of interest to you. Acceptable options include: \code{'all'},
\code{'icdcm'}, \code{'superlevel'}, \code{'broad'}, \code{'midlevel'}, & \code{'detailed'}.

The default is \code{ref_type = 'all'}.}

\item{mykey}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies
the keyring:: service that can be used to access the Health & Human Services
Analytic Workspace (HHSAW).

The default is \code{mykey = 'hhsaw'}}

\item{icdcm_version}{an integer vector of length one specifying the ICD CM
version that you want to reference. Acceptable options include: \code{9}
& \code{10}.

The default is \code{icdcm_version = 10}.}
}
\value{
A data.table. The number of rows and columns are dependent upon the arguments
submitted to the function.
}
\description{
A function to view the complete list of ICD-9-CM OR ICD-10-CM codes and
descriptions as well as corresponding 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications.
The 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications broadly follow AHRQ's HCUP Clinical
Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) standards for ICD-10-CM. ICD-9-CM
codes were then mapped to the same 'broad' and 'detailed' categories to maximize
comparability across time. The 'superlevel' and 'midlevel' categorizations
were developed by APDE, based in large part on the 'broad' and 'detailed'
classifications.

Output is provided in the form of a table. Use this table to inform your
arguments in the  \code{chars_icd_ccs_count} function.
}
\note{
If you do not specify any arguments, the function will return a table with
all ICD-10-CM codes as well ICD-10-CM, superlevel, broad, midlevel, and
detailed descriptions.

\examples{
# Save and view table as a data.table named 'blah'
