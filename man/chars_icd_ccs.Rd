\title{View available CHARS ICD-9-CM OR ICD-10-CM (diagnosis) codes, descriptions,
and summary 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications that can be used with
\code{\link[=chars_icd_ccs_count]{chars_icd_ccs_count()}}}
\source{
Reference tables \link[rads.data:icd9cm_ccs]{rads.data::icd9cm_ccs} and \link[rads.data:icd10cm_ccs]{rads.data::icd10cm_ccs}

\usage{
chars_icd_ccs(ref_type = "all", icdcm_version = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{ref_type}{a character vector of length one specifying the hospital diagnosis
descriptions that are of interest to you. Acceptable options include: \code{'all'},
\code{'icdcm'}, \code{'superlevel'}, \code{'broad'}, \code{'midlevel'}, & \code{'detailed'}.

The default is \code{ref_type = 'all'}.}

\item{icdcm_version}{an integer vector of length one specifying the ICD CM
version that you want to reference. Acceptable options include: \code{9}
or \code{10}.

The default is \code{icdcm_version = 10}.}
}
\value{
A data.table. The number of rows and columns are dependent upon the arguments
submitted to the function.
}
\description{
A function to view the complete list of ICD-9-CM OR ICD-10-CM codes and
descriptions as well as corresponding 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications.
The 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications broadly follow AHRQ's HCUP Clinical
Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) standards for ICD-10-CM. ICD-9-CM
codes were then mapped to the same 'broad' and 'detailed' categories to maximize
comparability across time. The 'superlevel' and 'midlevel' categorizations
were developed by APDE, based in large part on the 'broad' and 'detailed'
classifications.

Output is provided in the form of a table. Use this table to inform your
arguments in the \code{\link[=chars_icd_ccs_count]{chars_icd_ccs_count()}} function.
}
\note{
If you do not specify any arguments, the function will return a table with
all ICD-10-CM codes as well ICD-10-CM, superlevel, broad, midlevel, and
detailed descriptions.
