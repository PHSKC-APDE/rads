\title{A wrapper to compute metrics (specifically relative fraction and totals) from factor/character variables}
\usage{
calc_factor(svy, what, by, time_var, fancy_time = TRUE, ci = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{svy}{survey.design2 (or tbl_svy). Survey from which metrics will be computed}

\item{what}{character or symbol.}

\item{by}{character or symbol vector}

\item{time_var}{character or symbol}

\item{fancy_time}{logical. If FALSE, a record of all the years going into the data is provided. If true, just a simple range (where certain years within the range might not be represented)}

\item{ci}{numeric. Confidence level, >0 & <1, typically 0.95}
}
\description{
A wrapper to compute metrics (specifically relative fraction and totals) from factor/character variables
}
\details{
Under the hood, \code{\link[survey]{svyciprop}} and \code{\link[survey]{svytotal}} do the heavy lifting.
