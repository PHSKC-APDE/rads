\source{
Reference table \link[rads.data:icdcm_injury_matrix]{rads.data::icdcm_injury_matrix} created by
\code{\link[rads.internal:make_chars_injury_matrix]{rads.internal::make_chars_injury_matrix()}}.
}
\usage{
chars_injury_matrix()
}
\value{
A data.table with two columns: \code{mechanism} & \code{intent}. The number

\description{
Function to view all combinations of the Comprehensive
Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) Injury Matrix mechanisms and
intents available in rads.

Generates a table with two columns, \code{mechanism} & \code{intent}.
Use it to identify the combinations of \code{mechanism} & \code{intent} that
you want to use in \code{\link[=chars_injury_matrix_count]{chars_injury_matrix_count()}}.
}
\details{
This function provides the terms used by the hospitalization function
\code{\link[=chars_injury_matrix_count]{chars_injury_matrix_count()}} and may not be the same as those used with
\code{\link[=death_injury_matrix_count]{death_injury_matrix_count()}}.
}
\note{
This function does not take any arguments.

This function will return all available categories, some of which are specific
to ICD9-cm (2012-2015) and some of which are specific to ICD10-cm (2016+).
