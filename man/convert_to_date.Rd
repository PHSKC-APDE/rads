\title{Convert Numeric and Character Data to Dates}
\usage{
convert_to_date(x, origin = "1899-12-30")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric or character vector that needs to be converted to the date
format.}

\item{origin}{A character string specifying the origin date for numeric
conversions. It must be in "\%Y-\%m-\%d" format.

The default is "1899-12-30".}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of class \code{Date}. If conversion is not possible for
some values, those values will be replaced with \code{NA}. If none of the original
values can be converted, the original vector will be returned.
}
\description{
This function attempts to convert specified values, vectors, or table columns
into date format when possible. The function handles numeric values by
treating them as the number of days since a specified origin date, with the
default being "1899-12-30" (Excel's origin date). It also attempts to parse
character vectors according to common date formats.
}
\details{
The function handles different input types:
\itemize{
\item If \code{x} is already a Date object, it is returned unchanged.
\item Numeric values are treated as the number of days since \code{origin}.
\item Character values are parsed using several common American date formats.
If all conversion attempts fail, a warning is issued and the original data
is returned.
}
}
\examples{
convert_to_date(c("2024-01-01", "February 13, 1999", "2024/02/01", "03/21/2000", "Not date"))
convert_to_date(c(42005, 42006), origin = "1899-12-30")
convert_to_date(c('puppies', 'kittens'))
