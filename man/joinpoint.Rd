\usage{
joinpoint(
  jp_data = NULL,
  jp_indicator = NULL,
  jp_period = "chi_year",
  jp_result = "result",
  jp_se = "se",
  jp_byvar1 = "cat1_group",
  jp_byvar2 = "cat2_group",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{jp_data}{Name of a data.table or data.frame containing the trend data to be asssessed}

\item{jp_indicator}{character vector of length 1. Identifies the column name for the indicator of interest}

\item{jp_period}{character vector of length 1. Idenitifies the column name with the time element
over which the trend will be assessed.}

\item{jp_result}{character vector of length 1. Idenitifies the column with the point estimate for the given period}

\item{jp_se}{character vector of length 1. Identifies the column with the standard error corresponding to jp_result}

\item{jp_byvar1}{character vector of length 1. Identifies the column with the "by-variables", e.g., sex}

\item{jp_byvar2}{character vector of length 1. In the event of a cross-tabulation, identifies the column with the
second set of "by-variables". E.g., age strata}

\item{jp_dir}{character vector of length 1. Specifies the complete file path where JoinPoint data
input and output data should be saved}

\item{jp_path}{character vector of length 1. Specifies the filepath to the JoinPoint executable.}
}
\value{
a data.table with five columns: 1) <tab>, which specifies it is for displaying trend data, 2) jp_indicator,
3) jp_byvar1, 4) jp_byvar2, and 5) <time_trends>, which has summarized trend results
}
\description{
JoinPoint is statistical software used for analyzing trends. Information and downloads
are available here: https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/
}
\details{
This functions facilitates running the JoinPoint executable using R to create standardized
output. It also saves essential JointPoint input and output data so that results can be
viewed in JointPoint Desktop.

The dataset should have only one row per unique combination of jp_indicator, jp_byvar1,
jp_byvar2, & jp_period
