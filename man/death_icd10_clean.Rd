}
\details{
This function prepares ICD-10 codes for processing with the death functions
in the \code{rads} package. It performs cleaning and tidying operations, such as
converting codes to uppercase, removing non-alphanumeric characters (e.g.,
hyphens and periods), validating the ICD-10 code format, trimming codes to a
maximum of 4 characters, and padding shorter codes with zeros when needed.
It is used internally by \code{rads} death functions but can also be used as a
standalone function.
