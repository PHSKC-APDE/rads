\title{Convert modified BRFSS data.table to an imputationList}
\usage{
as_imputed_brfss(ph.data)
}
\arguments{
\item{ph.data}{A \code{\link[dtsurvey]{dtsurvey}}/data.table containing BRFSS
survey data, typically created using \code{\link{as_table_brfss}}}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} containing 10 imputed datasets,
each a survey-weighted \code{\link[dtsurvey]{dtsurvey}}/data.table with
different HRA and region assignments based on ZIP code probabilities.
}
\description{
Converts a modified BRFSS \code{\link[dtsurvey]{dtsurvey}}/data.table back into
a \code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} by creating multiple imputed datasets
for HRA and region assignments. This is necessary after modifying variables in
BRFSS data that contains HRA or region variables.
}
\details{
When working with BRFSS data that includes Health Reporting Area (HRA) or region
variables, modifications to the data must be made on a single data.table.
After modifications are complete, this function recreates the proper
\code{\link[mitools]{imputationList}} structure required for analysis of
HRA and region variables.

This function:
\itemize{
\item Creates 10 copies of your modified dataset
\item Assigns different HRA IDs to each copy based on ZIP code probabilities
\item Adds corresponding HRA names and region assignments
\item Combines the copies into an imputationList
}
}

# Starting with a modified BRFSS data.table
brfss_table[, age_category := fcase(
  age \%in\% 18:66, "working age",
  age >= 67, "retirement age",
  default = NA_character_
)]

# Convert back to imputationList for analysis
brfss_imputed <- as_imputed_brfss(brfss_table)

# Now ready for analysis with rads::calc()
}
