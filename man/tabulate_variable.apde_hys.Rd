}
\arguments{
\item{svy}{tab_svy. HYS dataset}

\item{variable}{Character vector. Variable(s) to be tabulated according to the subsetting/grouping instructions implied by the other variables}

\item{metrics}{Character vector. Metrics to be returned. Options include, mean, lower, upper, median, numerator, and denominator. Default is all.}

\item{sex}{character vector. One of 'both' or 'seperate'. 'seperate' returns results for each sex (at birth-- meaning male or female) while 'both' will provide a both sex estimate}

\item{grade}{numeric vector or a list of numeric vectors. Determines how grades will be grouped. See details for how to structure the input. Default is all grades.}

\item{region}{Character vector or a list of character vectors. Determines how regions will be grouped. See details for how to structure the input. Default is all regions (e.g. King County).}

\item{race}{character vector or a list of character vectors. Three standard options exist: 'all', 'all-NH' and 'aic'.
With 'all', each race is computed seperately, with the caveat that the multiple race category includes hispanic
'All-NH' is like 'all', but the multiple race category is also non-hispanic/
'aic' indicates that the rest of the instructions will be looped over, once per aic race class.
Instructions passed in the list format (or as character vectors length > 1) described below will be checked to ensure no mismatch between aic and non-aic designations.
The variable underpinning 'all' will be used when non-aic values are present.}

\item{year}{numeric vector or a list of numeric vectors. See details for how to structure the input.}

\item{sexual_orientation}{character vector or a list of character vectors. See details for how to structure the input.}

\item{na.rm}{logical. Removes rows with NA by variables from the results.}

\item{...}{unused}

\value{
a data.table containing the results of the tabulation.

\description{
Tabulate data from HYS
}
\details{
Function arguments, `grade`, `region`, `race`, `year`, and `sexual_orientation`, largely exist to standardize `by` type of operations.
Unless otherwise noted in the parameter-specific descriptions, a vector of a certain type or a (named) list of those vectors are expected-- and vectors will be converted into a list of length 1.
Each item of the list will be grouped together. For example, passing \code{list(8, c(10,12))} as the response to the `grade` argument indicates that the tabulation will return
results (e.g. seperate rows) for 8th graders and then 10th & 12th graders combined. There should also be no duplicate values or grouping.
For example, passing \code{list(8, c(8,10,12))} as a response to the `grade` argument will throw an error because the value 8 appears more than once.
If the input is named (e.g. \code{list(`Middle Schoolers` = c(8,10), `High Schoolers` = c(10, 12))}), the resulting tabulation will inherit that naming.
Otherwise, a name will be inferred from the column name and values. Passing \code{NULL} will default to grouping by all non-NA values in the underlying variable.
