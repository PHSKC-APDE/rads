List of available metric for \code{calc}
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item total: Count of people with the given value. Mostly relevant for surveys
(where total is approximately mean * sum(pweights)).
Returns total, total_se, total_upper, total_lower.
total_se, total_upper, & total_lower are only valid for survey data.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.
\item mean: Average response and associated metrics of uncertainty.
Returns mean, mean_se, mean_lower, mean_upper.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.
\item rse: Relative standard error. 100*se/mean.
\item numerator: Sum of non-NA values for `what``.
The numerator is always unweighted.
\item denominator: Number of rows where \code{what} is not NA.
The denominator is always unweighted.
\item obs: Number of unique observations (i.e., rows), agnostic as to whether
there is missing data for \code{what}. The obs is always unweighted.
\item median: The median non NA response. Not populated when \code{what} is a factor
or character. Even for surveys, the median is the unweighted result.
\item unique.time: Number of unique time points (from \code{time_var}) included in
each tabulation (i.e., number of unique time points when the \code{what} is not missing).
\item missing: Number of rows in a given grouping with an NA value for \code{what}.
missing + denominator = Number of people in a given group.
When \code{what} is a factor/character, the missing information is provided for the other.
\item missing.prop: The proportion of the data that has an NA value for \code{what}.
\item rate: mean * per. Provides rescaled mean estimates (i.e., per 100 or per 100,0000).
Returns rate, rate_se, rate_lower, rate_upper.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.
\item ndistinct: The unique number of \code{what} values in the given subset. For factors, it is the unique number of levels in the subset.
