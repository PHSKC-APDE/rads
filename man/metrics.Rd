metrics()
}
\value{
character vector. A vector of the available metrics for `calc`
}
\description{
List of available metric for `calc`
}
\details{
1) total: Count of people with the given value. Mostly relevant for surveys
(where total is approximately mean * sum(pweights)).
Returns total, total_se, total_upper, total_lower.
total_se, total_upper, & total_lower are only valid for survey data.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.

2) mean: Average response and associated metrics of uncertainty.
Returns mean, mean_se, mean_lower, mean_upper.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.

3) rse: Relative standard error. 100*se/mean.

4) numerator: Sum of non-NA values for `what``.
The numerator is always unweighted.

5) denominator: Number of rows where `what` is not NA.
The denominator is always unweighted.

6) obs: Number of unique observations (i.e., rows), agnostic as to whether
there is missing data for `what`. The obs is always unweighted.

7) median: The median non NA response. Not populated when `what` is a factor
or character. Even for surveys, the median is the unweighted result.

8) unique.time: Number of unique time points (from `time_var`) included in
each tabulation (i.e., number of unique time points when the `what` is not missing).

9) missing: Number of rows in a given grouping with an NA value for `what`.
   missing + denominator = Number of people in a given group.
   When `what` is a factor/character, the missing information is provided for the other.

10) missing.prop: The proportion of the data that has an NA value for `what`.

11) rate: mean * per. Provides rescaled mean estimates (i.e., per 100 or per 100,0000).
Returns rate, rate_se, rate_lower, rate_upper.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.
