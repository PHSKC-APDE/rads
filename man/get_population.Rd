\arguments{
\item{kingco}{Logical vector of length 1. Identifies whether you want
population estimates limited to King County. Only impacts results for
geo_type in c('blk', blkgrp', 'lgd', 'scd', 'tract', 'zip').

Default == TRUE.}

\item{years}{Numeric vector. Identifies which year(s) of data should be
pulled.

Default == 2022.}

\item{ages}{Numeric vector. Identifies which age(s) should be pulled.

Default == c(0:100), with 100 being the top coded value for 100:120.}

\item{genders}{Character vector of length 1 or 2. Identifies gender(s) should
be pulled. The acceptable values are 'f', 'female', 'm', and 'male'.

Default == c('f', 'm').}

\item{races}{Character vector of length 1 to 7. Identifies which race(s) or
ethnicity should be pulled. The acceptable values are "aian",
"asian", "black", "hispanic", "multiple", "nhpi", and "white".

Default == all the possible values.}

\item{race_type}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies whether to pull
race data with Hispanic as an ethnicity ("race"), Hispanic as a race
("race_eth"), or each race, including Hispanic, alone and in combination ('race_aic').

Default == c("race_eth").}

\item{geo_type}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the geographic level
for which you want population estimates. The acceptable values are: 'blk',
'blkgrp', 'county', 'hra', 'kc', 'lgd' (WA State legislative districts),
'region', 'seattle', 'scd' (school districts), 'tract', 'wa', and 'zip'.

Default == "kc".}

\item{group_by}{Character vector. Identifies how you would
like the data 'grouped' (i.e., stratified). Valid options are limited to:
"years", "ages", "genders", "race", "race_eth", or "race_aic".
If "race" or "race_aic" are the \code{race_type} then they must be included in
\code{group_by}. Results are always grouped by geo_id.

Default == NULL, i.e., estimates are only grouped / aggregated by
geography.}

\item{round}{Logical vector of length 1. Identifies whether or not population
estimates should be returned as whole numbers.

Default == FALSE. As of 02/2023.}

\item{mykey}{Character vector of length 1 OR a database connection. Identifies
the keyring:: key that can be used to access the Health & Human Services
Analytic Workspace (HHSAW).

Default == 'hhsaw'}

\item{census_vintage}{Integer. One of 2010 or 2020. Refers to latest Census
to influence the set of population estimates

Default == 2020}

\item{geo_vintage}{Integer. One of 2010 or 2020. Refers to the the Census
that influenced the creation of the geographies. See details for notes.

Default == 2020}

\item{schema}{character. Name of the schema in the db where pop data is stored.
\emph{Unless you know what you are doing, do not change the default!}

Default = 'ref'}

\item{table_prefix}{character. Prefix of the tables in \code{schema} where pop data
is stored. The table will be selected as {schema}.pop_geo_{geo_type} unless
geo_type is aggregated on the fly from blocks. \emph{Unless you know what you
are doing, do not change the default!}

Default = 'pop_geo_'}

\item{return_query}{logical. Instead of computing the results, return the
query for fetching the results

Default == FALSE}
}
\value{
dataset as a data.table for further analysis/tabulation

\description{
Simple front-end for pulling in standard population data
from SQL
}
\details{
Note the following geography limitations:

-- 'county', 'lgd', 'scd', and 'zip' apply to all of WA State

-- 'hra', 'kc', 'region', and 'seattle' apply to King County only

-- 'blk', 'blkgrp', and 'tract' apply to King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties
only

Note on geo_vintage:
ZIP codes and school districts (scd) are unaffected by geo_vintage.
ZIP codes are year specific when possible and school districts are mostly considered fixed.

For all other geographies, the value should represent the vintage/era of the Census
