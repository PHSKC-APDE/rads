\title{Get OFM population estimates from SQL}
\usage{
get_population(
  kingco = T,
  years = c(2020),
  ages = c(0:100),
  genders = c("F", "M"),
  races = c("aian", "asian", "black", "hispanic", "multiple", "nhpi", "white"),
  race_type = c("race_eth"),
  geo_type = c("kc"),
  group_by = NULL,
  round = T,
  mykey = "hhsaw"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{kingco}{Logical vector of length 1. Identifies whether you want population estimates limited to King County. Default == TRUE.}

\item{years}{Numeric vector. Identifies which year(s) of data should be pulled. Default == c(2020).}

\item{ages}{Numeric vector. Identifies which age(s) should be pulled. Default == c(0:100), with 100 being the top coded value for 100:120.}

\item{genders}{Character vector of length 1 or 2. Identifies gender(s) should be pulled. The acceptable values are 'f', 'female', 'm', and 'male'.
Default == c('F', 'M').}

\item{races}{Character vector of length 1 to 7. Identifies which race(s) or ethnicity should be pulled. The acceptable values are "aian",
"asian", "black", "hispanic", "multiple", "nhpi", and "white". Default == all the possible values.}

\item{race_type}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies whether to pull race data with Hispanic as an ethnicity ("race") or Hispanic as a race ("race_eth").
Default == c("race_eth").}

\item{geo_type}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the geographic level for which you want population estimates. Possible values are
"kc", "seattle, "blk", "blkgrp", "hra", "region", "tract", and "zip". Note that all these geo_types except "zip" are available for King,
Pierce, and Snohomish counties only. Default == "kc".}

\item{group_by}{Character vector of length 0 to 7. Identifies how you would like the data 'grouped' (i.e., stratified). Valid options are limited to:
"years", "ages", "genders", "race", "race_eth", "fips_co", and "geo_id". Default == NULL, i.e., estimates are not grouped / stratified.}

\item{round}{Logical vector of length 1. Identifies whether or not population estimates should be returned as whole numbers. Default == TRUE.}

\item{mykey}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the keyring:: key that can be used to access the Health & Human Services Analytic Workspace (HHSAW).
Default == ‘hhsaw’}
