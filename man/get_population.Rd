\usage{
get_population(
  kingco = T,
  years = c(2019),
  ages = c(0:100),
  genders = c("F", "M"),
  races = c("aian", "asian", "black", "hispanic", "multiple", "nhpi", "white"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{kingco}{Logical vector of length 1. Identifies whether you want population estimates limited to King County.}

\item{years}{Numeric vector. Identifies which year(s) of data should be pulled}

\item{ages}{Numeric vector. Identifies which age(s) should be pulled}

\item{genders}{Character vector of length 1 or 2.Identifies gender(s) should be pulled.}

\item{races}{Character vector of length 1 to 7. Identifies which race(s) or ethnicity should be pulled}

\item{race_type}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies whether to pull race data with Hispanic as an ethnicity ("race") or Hispanic as a race (“race_eth”)}

\item{geo_type}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the geographic level for which you want population estimates}

\item{group_by}{Character vector of length 0 to 7. Identifies how you would like the data 'grouped' (i.e., stratified)}

\item{round}{Logical vector of length 1. Identifies whether or not population estimates should be returned as whole numbers}

\item{mykey}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the keyring:: key that can be used to access the Health & Human Services Analytic Workspace (HHSAW)}
