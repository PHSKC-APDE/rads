\title{Calculate crude and directly adjusted rates}
\usage{
adjust_direct(count, pop, stdpop, per = 1e+05, conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{count}{Numeric vector of indeterminate length. The # of events of interest (e.g., deaths, births, etc.)}

\item{pop}{Numeric vector of indeterminate length. The population denominator for the count.}

\item{stdpop}{Numeric vector of indeterminate length. The reference standard population corresponding to the population.}

\item{per}{Integer vector of length 1. A multiplier for all rates and CI, e.g., when per = 1000, the rates are per 1000 people}

\item{conf.level}{A numeric vector of length 1. The confidence interval used in the calculations.}
}
\value{
a labeled numeric vector of the count, rate, and adjusted rate with the CI
}

Calculate crude and directly adjusted rates

\section{Data anomalies}{

When \code{pop < count} (which can occur after collapsing age groups to match the
reference standard population) or when \code{pop = 0}, \code{adjust_direct()} internally
uses adjusted values for calculations while preserving the original population
values in the output. This ensures that age-adjusted rates can still be
calculated. The adjustment only nominally biases the calculated rates since
the affected counts are typically small.

If you are calling a wrapper function that prepares data for \code{adjust_direct()}
(like \code{\link[=age_standardize]{age_standardize()}}), you may see a warning that notes this adjustment
and identifies the affected age groups. The actual change is made within
\code{adjust_direct()} itself.

}

\code{\link[=age_standardize]{age_standardize()}} for a useful wrapper that calls upon standard reference populations.
