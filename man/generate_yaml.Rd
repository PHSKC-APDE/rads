  schema = NULL,
  table = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydt}{the name of a data.table or data.frame for which you want to create a YAML file}

\item{outfile}{optional character vector of length one. The complete filepath for where the *.yaml file

\item{schema}{A character vector of length one. The schema to be used within the specific server and
database that will be specified in your odbc connection.}

\item{table}{A character vector of length one. The table to be used within the specific server and

\donttest{
data(mtcars)
# output to object in memory
  check <- generate_yaml(mtcars, schema = "SCH", table = "TBL",
  datasource = "R standard mtcars")
# output to a file
  output_file <- tempfile('output_file', fileext = ".yaml")
  generate_yaml(mtcars, outfile = output_file, schema = "SCH", table = "TBL",
  datasource = "R standard mtcars")
