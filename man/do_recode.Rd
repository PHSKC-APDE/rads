\title{Recode a vector}
\usage{
do_recode(x, old, new, new_label = NULL, update = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{some vector to be transformed}

\item{old}{character (or coercible). value in the x to be translated into a new value by recoding.}

\item{new}{character (or coercible). Column indicating where the new values for the recoding process exist. It is positionally  tied to a particular \code{old}.
If blank, it helps identify a simpler rename operation.}

\item{new_label}{character (or convertable to character). The factor label that \code{old} will be recoded to in conjunction with the position of \code{new}.
If NULL or all NA indicates no (new) labelling}

\item{update}{logical. Governs whether x is modified in place. If \code{x} is a factor, this will also carry forward any labels unless overwritten by new_label}

\item{verbose}{logical. Should warnings be displayed/provided?}
