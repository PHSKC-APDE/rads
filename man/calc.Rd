\arguments{
\item{ph.data}{data.table or tbl_svy. Dataset.}

\item{...}{not implemented}

\item{what}{character vector. Variable to calculate metrics for.}

\item{where}{subsetting expression}

\item{by}{character vector. Must refer to variables within ph.data. The variables within ph.data to compute `what` by}

\item{metrics}{character. See \code{\link{metrics}} or scroll below for the available options.}

\item{per}{integer. The denominator when "rate" or "adjusted-rate" are selected as the metric. Metrics will be multiplied by this value.}

\item{win}{integer. The number of consectutive units of time (e.g., years, months, etc.) over which the metrics will be calculated,
i.e., the 'window' for a rolling average, sum, etc.}

\item{time_var}{character. The name of the time variable in the dataset. Used in combination with the "win" argument to do time windowed calculations.}

\item{proportion}{logical. For survey data, should metrics be calculated assuming the output is proportion-like? See details for more.
Currently does not have functionality for non-survey data.}

\item{fancy_time}{logical. If TRUE, a record of all the years going into the data is provided. If FALSE, just a simple range (where certain years within the range might not be represented)}

\item{ci}{numeric. Confidence level, >0 & <1, typically 0.95}

\item{verbose}{logical. Mostly unused, but toggles on/off printed warnings.}

\description{
Compute metrics from record (e.g. vital stats) or survey data
}
\details{
This function calculates `metrics` for each variable in `what` from rows meeting the conditions specified
by `where` for each grouping implied by `by`.

Available metrics include:

1) total: Count of people with the given value. Mostly relevant for surveys
(where total is approximately mean * sum(pweights)).
Returns total, total_se, total_upper, total_lower.
total_se, total_upper, & total_lower are only valid for survey data.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.

2) mean: Average response and associated metrics of uncertainty.
Returns mean, mean_se, mean_lower, mean_upper.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.

3) rse: Relative standard error. 100*se/mean.

4) numerator: Sum of non-NA values for `what``.
The numerator is always unweighted.

5) denominator: Number of rows where `what` is not NA.
The denominator is always unweighted.

6) obs: Number of unique observations (i.e., rows), agnostic as to whether
there is missing data for `what`. The obs is always unweighted.

7) median: The median non NA response. Not populated when `what` is a factor
or character. Even for surveys, the median is the unweighted result.

8) unique.time: Number of unique time points (from `time_var`) included in
each tabulation (i.e., number of unique time points when the `what` is not missing).

9) missing: Number of rows in a given grouping with an NA value for `what`.
   missing + denominator = Number of people in a given group.
   When `what` is a factor/character, the missing information is provided for the other.

10) missing.prop: The proportion of the data that has an NA value for `what`.

11) rate: mean * per. Provides rescaled mean estimates (i.e., per 100 or per 100,0000).
Returns rate, rate_se, rate_lower, rate_upper.
Default ci (e.g. upper and lower) is 95 percent.


For survey data, use the \code{proportion} argument where relevant to ensure metrics are calculated using special proportion (e.g \code{svyciprop})
methods. That is, when you want to find the fraction of ____, toggle \code{proportion} to \code{TRUE}.

#record data
test.data <- get_data_birth(year = 2015:2017)

test.results <- calc(test.data,
                     what = c("kotelchuck", "fetal_pres"),

                      by = c("chi_year", "chi_sex"),
                      metrics = c("mean", "numerator", "denominator",
                                  "total"))
