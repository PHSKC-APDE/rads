\arguments{
\item{ph.data}{data.table or tbl_svy. Dataset.}

\item{...}{expressions to be passed to \code{\link{filter}} (or equivalent)}

\item{what}{character vector. Variable to calculate metrics for.}

\item{by}{character vector. Must refer to variables within ph.data. The variables within ph.data to compute `what` by}

\item{metrics}{character. See \code{\link{record_metrics}} for the available options. Note, except when 'distinct' is
selected, all metrics are calculated -- this argument just specifies which one gets returned}

\item{per}{integer. The denominator when "rate" or "adjusted-rate" are selected as the metric. Metrics will be multiplied by this value.}

\item{win}{integer. The number of consectutive units of time (e.g., years, months, etc.) over which the metrics will be calculated,
i.e., the 'window' for a rolling average, sum, etc.}

\item{time_var}{character. The name of the time variable in the dataset. Used in combination with the "win" argument to do time windowed calculations.}

\item{proportion}{logical. For survey data, should metrics be calculated assuming the output is proportion-like? See details for more.
Currently does not have functionality for non-survey data.}

\item{verbose}{logical. Mostly unused, but toggles on/off printed warnings.}

\description{
Compute metrics from record (e.g. vital stats) or survey data
}
\details{
This function calculates `metrics` for each variable in `what` from rows meeting the conditions specified
by `...` (i.e., where), for each grouping implied by `by`.

Available metrics include:
1) mean: Average response
2) se: standard error
3) lower: lower part of a normal 95% ci (e.g. 2.5th percentile draw)
4) upper: upper part of a normal 95% ci (e.g. 97.5th percentile draw)
5) numerator: sum of non-na values for `what``
6) denominator: number of rows where `what` is not NA
7) total: roughly the sum of weight * `what` with NAs removed. Weights are implicitly 1 for record data and therefore total will equal numerator
8) total_se: For surveys. the standard error of the survey total estimate
9) missing: Number of rows in a given grouping with an NA value for `what`. missing + denominator = Number of people in a given group
10) res: relative standard error. mean/se
11) missing.prop: missing/(missing + denominator)
12) ndistinct: number of non-na distinct values `what` takes on in a given grouping (after filtering and all that jazz)

For survey data, use the \code{proportion} argument where relevant to ensure metrics are calculated using special proportion (e.g \code{svyciprop})
methods. That is, when you want to find the fraction of ____, toggle \code{proportion} to \code{TRUE}.

#record data
test.data <- get_data_birth(year = 2015:2017)

test.results <- calc(test.data,
                     what = c("kotelchuck", "fetal_pres"),
                     "chi_year == 2016 & chi_sex \%in\% c('Male', 'Female')",
                      by = c("chi_year", "chi_sex"),
                      metrics = c("mean", "numerator", "denominator",
                                  "total", "lower", "upper", "se"))
