\title{Calculate age standardized rates from a data.table with age, counts, and population columns. (Built on adjust_direct())}
\usage{
age_standardize(
  my.dt,
  ref.popname = NULL,
  collapse = T,
  my.count = "count",
  my.pop = "pop",
  per = 1e+05,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  group_by = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{my.dt}{Name of a data.frame or data.table object. Note, if my.dt already has a standard population (ref.popname = "none"),
it must contain a numeric column named 'stdpop'. Otherwise, it must contain a numeric column named 'age'.}

\item{ref.popname}{Character vector of length 1. Only valid options are those in list_ref_pop() and
"none" (when standard population already exists in my.dt)}

\item{collapse}{Logical vector of length 1. Do you want to collapse my.dt ages to match those in ref.popname?}

\item{my.count}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the column with the count data aggregated by the given demographics.}

\item{my.pop}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the column with the population corresponding to the given demographics.}

\item{per}{Integer vector of length 1. A multiplier for all rates and CI, e.g., when per = 1000, the rates are per 1000 people}

\item{conf.level}{A numeric vector of length 1. The confidence interval used in the calculations.}

\item{group_by}{Character vector of indeterminate length. By which variable(s) do you want to stratify the rate results, if any?}
}
\value{
a data.table of the count, rate & adjusted rate with CIs, name of the reference population and the 'group_by' variable(s) -- if any
}
