#' QA for CHI/Tableau ready standards using R.
#'
#' @description
#' This functions seeks to ensure that the data being assessed meet the detailed CHI
#' Tableau Ready standards detailed on our network drive:
#' "//phshare01/epe_share/WORK/CHI Visualizations/Tableau Ready Output Format_v2.xlsx"
#'
#' @details
#' This function ensures that the structure of the data matches all CHI Tableau Ready
#' specifications. QA for data quality vis-Ã -vis previous production data, CHAT, or any other source,
#' must be performed seperately
#'
#'
#' @param chi_data Name of a data.table or data.frame containing the prepared data, typically processed by RADS
#'
#' @return If there are no problems, a printed statement of success. Otherwise, it will stop and provide informative
#' feedback everytime there is an error.

  ## Compare with previous year's results (FOR FUTURE???)----
      # in function arguments, have user submit most recent and comparison year(s). Submit as character b/c can be 2013-2017, not just 2017
      # if both are null, skip the comparison
      # it not submitted, merge newer data on old data and identify rows with > 3% absolute difference
      # save this dataset for manual review by the user
  ## Compare with a CSV (FOR FUTURE) ----
      # sometimes want to compare with external data source ---
      # must identify year of interest as above
      # instead of submitting a reference year, the user specifies a reference file
      # reference file will attempt to match on all columns that have the same name, except those with results (i.e., results, lower_bound, se, etc.)
      # actual comparison code should be the same as when comparing to a previous year, so write a small funcion to do this
