\usage{
chi_compare(
  orig,
  merge.by = c("indicator_key", "year"),
  compare.name = "comparison_with_kc"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{orig}{Character vector of length 1. Identifies the data.table/data.frame to be fetched. Note the table must have the following columns:
'result', 'lower_bound', & 'upper_bound' and all three must be numeric}

\item{merge.by}{Character vector of indeterminate length. It specifies the unique combination of variables needed to merge the comparator
data onto the main data. Typically, all that is needed is an indicator_key and a time indicator}

\item{compare.name}{Character vector of length 1. It is the name of the column containining the comparison results.}
}
\value{
data.table comprised of the original data.table and two additional columns ... 'significance' and 'comparison_with_kc' (or alternatively specified name)
}
